# GraphQL
Hi! This is a simple study-related application, focused on creating and reading data using GraphQL.

## Install
After cloning the repository on your machine...


  Go to the backend folder and initialize the server with the script ˋnpm run devˋ.
  
  
  In the frontend folder, initialize the client with the script ˋnpm run devˋ

## So many things to do!
As you can see, this project is just starting. The next steps are to improve front-end viewing and insert new features, such as deleting a user. Also, I want to implement a page explaining about the technologies and concepts applied.

## Can you help me?
Feel free to fork the project and make the changes you want. If you want to help me or talk to me, send me a message on [Linkedin!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lysialeao189411199/)
